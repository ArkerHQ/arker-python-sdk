"""Parse a Dockerfile into the instruction list the SDK build driver walks.

Text in, instructions out — no network, no VM, no filesystem. The driver in
``build.py`` is what executes them: ``FROM`` becomes a real image fork, ``RUN``
becomes ``vm.run(...)``, ``COPY`` becomes a directory sync into the VM.

## Why this lives in the SDK and not on the server

Every instruction except ``COPY`` is self-contained text that a server could
interpret perfectly well — and one used to. ``COPY`` is different: its sources
are files on the machine running this code. A server-side build would need the
client to upload a build context first, which means an upload endpoint, object
storage, context ids, and a size ceiling on however big someone's project is.

Driving the build from here removes all of that. ``COPY`` becomes
``vm.sync_dir(...)``, which already streams a tarball into the guest and, being
manifest-diffed, ships only the files that actually changed.

## Scope

Supported: ``FROM``, ``RUN``, ``COPY``, ``ADD <url>``, ``ENV``, ``WORKDIR``,
``USER``, ``ARG``, ``LABEL``, ``EXPOSE``, ``ENTRYPOINT``, ``CMD``.

Refused by name, rather than silently dropped:

* **Multi-stage builds** — more than one ``FROM``, or a ``COPY --from=``.
  Resolving stage aliases and deciding what a final stage means for a single
  long-lived VM is its own feature.
* **``ARG``-substituted ``FROM``** — ``FROM`` resolves through a real image
  fork, so it has to be a literal reference.
* **Everything else** (``VOLUME``, ``ONBUILD``, ``HEALTHCHECK``, ``SHELL``,
  ``STOPSIGNAL``, ``MAINTAINER``, ...) — named in the error so an unsupported
  directive never passes silently.

``${VAR}`` substitution into instruction text is not performed. A ``RUN`` sees
``$VAR`` as an ordinary shell variable because the shell expands it; a
``WORKDIR /app-$VERSION`` does not, and is left as written.
